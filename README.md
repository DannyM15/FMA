# Portfolio Project


## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The motivation for this project was to create the first draft of a portfolio I can build off of.  I want to continue improving the portfolio until I am prepared to show it to prospective employers.
